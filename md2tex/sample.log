The cause seems to be an old format file in the user tree.
LaTeX found these files:

 - /var/lib/texmf/web2c/xetex/xelatex.fmt 
Try deleting the file in the user tree then run LaTeX again.
LaTeX will abort loading the incompatible support files but this may lead to
later errors. Please ensure that your LaTeX format is correctly regenerated.
